- working on harvadPhones_v3.txt
replacements:
-  ʌv  -> əv
- ɹ -> r

=> Unique symbols for complex phonemes like dʒ tʃ ks are left as two phonemes

Process v3 to get 
- list of unique characters
- total number of sentences, words, phonemes
- distribution n words/sent char/sent
- map transcription to alphabetic file 
- n-grams analysis (pending)


careful with apostrophes as they are badly transcribed john's jon'3s, don't dɑn'ti

Changes in symbols -> produced v4 of the ipa file

ɛ -> e
ɑ -> o
3 -> ɛ
final ɛ -> ə

 evɛi ->  evrɪ
